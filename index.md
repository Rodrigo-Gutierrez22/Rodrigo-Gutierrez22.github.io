### My favorite labs CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I have always enjoyed playing cards and blackjack is personally my favorite card game of them all. There were many different things that I learned from here but one specific one is the usage of const and when to apply it to my code and when it is required for our linting in the class. Linting being my worst nightmare when it came to our labs as once slight hiccup could ruin your linting or even formatting or tests.

* Lab 7 

    Lab 7 was the most fun and challenging of them all because there were honestly different ways to write the code to make sure the output of the code was correct. We unfortunately didn't learn that until the end of the lab and we were writing the code in a complicated manner but thankfully the proffessor saved us and taught us a much simpler way. This lab was also time consuming but once you reached a good flow and understood what was going on it was a good lab day.

* Lab 4 

    Lab 4 was another one of my favorite because not only did I enjoy working with the group I was assigned all three of us had great contributions to the coding and were all helping eachother. The lab itself wasn't the most difficult but it was fun and cool to be able to write clean code that passed the tests and formatting first try but not the linting unfortunately. This lab we were comptuing ml / tsp / and cups and it was cool involving math or conversion rates into coding as I am a math person.
